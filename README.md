**The execution layer for AgentLily instances — autonomous AI agents that manage finance on the Stellar network.**

`agentlily-runtime` is the TypeScript runtime that runs an **AgentLily**: an autonomous agent owned by Lily Protocol, the agent-finance infrastructure being built on **Stellar**. An AgentLily's job is to act on behalf of its controller — provisioning, preparing, and (soon) executing **Stellar wallet and payment tasks** with observable, auditable steps.

## Stellar at a Glance

- **`wallet.prepare_payment` tool (shipped today)** — a real, typed tool an AgentLily invokes to prepare a payment for its wallet: it validates the wallet and amount, defaults the asset to **native `XLM`**, and returns a simulated **Stellar transaction stub** (`stellar-stub-<taskId>-<walletId>-<sha256-intent>`) — no live network call, safe for contributors to extend toward real submission. The digest binds recipient, canonical Stellar asset identity (native XLM or issued code + issuer), canonical amount in stroops, and memo so distinct payment intents cannot share a stub ID; metadata is audit context and does not change payment identity. Issued assets fail closed when issuer identity is absent.
- **Payment-aware action boundary** — `src/actions/` shows how wallet/payment actions are structured; the scaffolding for executing against the live **Stellar network** (via Lily backend + Soroban contracts) is intentionally open contributor work.
- **Event-driven & auditable** — every task and tool invocation emits runtime events so Stellar finance actions are traceable from intent → prepared transaction stub.

This repository is intentionally designed as an open-source-ready runtime foundation, not a completed runtime product. It provides:

- A modular TypeScript runtime architecture
- One real happy-path execution flow for contributors to study and extend
- A shipped, Stellar-flavored `wallet.prepare_payment` tool
- Strict typing, tests, linting, and CI scaffolding
- Clear extension points for unfinished systems

## What Exists Today

The current implementation demonstrates a narrow, credible runtime path:

1. Create an `AgentRuntime`
2. Start the runtime and register tools (including `wallet.prepare_payment`)
3. Build a runtime context for a task
4. Execute a task through the task runner and action executor
5. Invoke a typed tool
6. Persist lightweight in-memory task history (or durable JSON file history via memoryStoragePath)
7. Emit runtime events and structured log entries

This gives contributors a working reference path without locking the project into premature architecture.

## What Is Intentionally Unfinished

The following areas are scaffolded with interfaces, types, or placeholders and are expected to become contributor work:

- **Live Stellar network execution** — turning prepared payment stubs into submitted transactions through the Lily backend (agent controllers approve first)
- Wallet-aware and payment-aware actions beyond the prep flow
- Persistent database and vector storage backends (basic file-based JSON persistence is supported via JsonFileMemoryStore)
- Model provider integrations (an `OpenAICompatibleModelProvider` scaffold is available for experimentation; note that it is scaffolded and intentionally not production-complete)
- Runtime policy engines and approval flows
- Long-running orchestration and scheduling
- Distributed execution and durable coordination
- Identity-aware execution logic
- Rich tracing, metrics, and production observability

## Requirements & Supported Node.js Versions

`agentlily-runtime` declares `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`. The CI workflow actively verifies formatting, linting, typechecking, and the full test suite across a matrix of supported Node.js LTS lines:

- **Node.js 20** (Declared baseline LTS floor)
- **Node.js 22** (Active LTS)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
```

Example:

```ts
import { AgentRuntime } from "@lily-protocol/agentlily-runtime";

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
  runtimeId: "local-dev"
});

runtime.registerTool({
  name: "echo",
  description: "Returns a string payload for test execution",
  async execute(input) {
    return { echoed: String(input.payload.message ?? "") };
  }
});

await runtime.start();

const result = await runtime.executeTask({
  agentId: "agent-demo",
  taskId: "task-001",
  toolName: "echo",
  input: "Send a greeting",
  payload: { message: "hello lily" }
});

console.log(result.output);
```

### Preparing a Stellar payment as an AgentLily

The shipped `wallet.prepare_payment` tool lets an AgentLily prepare a payment for one of its wallets without touching the live network:

```ts
import {
  AgentRuntime,
  createPaymentPrepTool
} from "@lily-protocol/agentlily-runtime";

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({ runtimeId: "agentlily-pay" });
runtime.registerTool(createPaymentPrepTool());

await runtime.start();

const prepared = await runtime.executeTask({
  agentId: "agentlily_treasury",
  taskId: "pay-001",
  toolName: "wallet.prepare_payment",
  input: "Prepare 25 XLM payment",
  payload: {
    walletId: "wallet_treasury",
    amount: "25.00",
    assetCode: "XLM",
    memo: "monthly rebalance"
  }
});

// prepared.output → {
//   status: "prepared",
//   transactionStubId: "stellar-stub-pay-001-wallet_treasury-<64-hex-intent-digest>",
//   assetCode: "XLM",
//   amount: "25.00",
//   isSimulated: true,
//   ...
// }
```

For stub identity, equivalent Stellar amount spellings resolve through their exact stroop value, so `"1"`, `"1.0"`, and numeric `1` share an ID when the rest of the payment intent is unchanged. Native XLM is represented by `assetCode: "XLM"` with no issuer. Any non-XLM issued asset must also provide `assetIssuer`; asset code alone is not sufficient identity. Changing the recipient, issued-asset code or issuer, amount, or memo changes the ID. `metadata` is returned for audit context but is intentionally excluded from payment identity.

## Runtime Events

`agentlily-runtime` exposes an event system via `RuntimeEventBus` to support observability, audit logs, and tracing adapters.

### Event Catalog (`RuntimeEventMap`)

| Event Name               | Description                                              | Key Payload Fields                                         |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `runtime.started`        | Emitted once when `runtime.start()` succeeds             | `runtimeId`, `occurredAt`                                  |
| `runtime.stopped`        | Emitted when `runtime.stop()` completes                  | `runtimeId`, `occurredAt`                                  |
| `runtime.task.received`  | Emitted when a task is accepted for execution            | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId`                           |
| `runtime.task.completed` | Emitted when a task executes successfully                | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId`, `toolName`, `durationMs` |
| `runtime.task.failed`    | Emitted when task execution fails                        | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId`, `reason`                 |
| `runtime.tool.invoked`   | Emitted when an individual tool action is invoked        | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId`, `toolName`, `invokedAt`  |
| `runtime.internal.error` | Emitted when an event listener throws an unhandled error | `eventName`, `errorMessage`, `occurredAt`                  |

### Subscribing to Events

You can inject a custom `RuntimeEventBus` during initialization or subscribe directly via `runtime.eventBus`:

```ts
import {
  AgentRuntime,
  RuntimeEventBus
} from "@lily-protocol/agentlily-runtime";

const eventBus = new RuntimeEventBus();

// Subscribe to task completion and failure events
const unsubscribeCompleted = eventBus.on("runtime.task.completed", (event) => {
  console.log(
    `Task ${event.payload.taskId} completed in ${event.payload.durationMs}ms`
  );
});

const unsubscribeFailed = eventBus.on("runtime.task.failed", (event) => {
  console.error(`Task ${event.payload.taskId} failed: ${event.payload.reason}`);
});

// Single-fire listener
eventBus.once("runtime.started", (event) => {
  console.log(`Runtime started at ${event.payload.occurredAt}`);
});

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
  runtimeId: "monitored-runtime",
  eventBus
});

await runtime.start();

// Unsubscribe when no longer needed
unsubscribeCompleted();
unsubscribeFailed();
```

## Durable Memory via JsonFileMemoryStore

For persistent task history across runtime restarts, configure `memoryStoragePath` in `RuntimeOptions`. When supplied, `AgentRuntime` initializes a `JsonFileMemoryStore` backing instance instead of the default ephemeral `InMemoryMemoryStore`.

```ts
import { AgentRuntime } from "@lily-protocol/agentlily-runtime";

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
  runtimeId: "persistent-runtime",
  memoryStoragePath: "./data/task-history.json"
});
```

### Persisted Entry Schema

Each entry appended to the storage file satisfies the `MemoryEntry` interface:

| Field        | Type      | Description                                      |
| :----------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `agentId`    | `string`  | ID of the agent associated with the task         |
| `taskId`     | `string`  | Unique identifier of the task                    |
| `input`      | `string`  | Input prompt or command given to the task        |
| `output`     | `unknown` | Tool execution output or result                  |
| `recordedAt` | `string`  | ISO 8601 timestamp of when the entry was written |

### Durability & Concurrency Caveats

- **File Rewrites:** `JsonFileMemoryStore` reads and rewrites the entire JSON array on each append (`flush()`), making it suitable for development, testing, or low-throughput scenarios rather than high-frequency production pipelines.
- **No Inherent Capacity Limit:** Unlike `InMemoryMemoryStore`, `JsonFileMemoryStore` currently does not enforce global FIFO eviction or per-agent capacity limits; entries grow monotonically unless cleared manually via `clear()`.
- **Multi-Process Concurrency:** Concurrent writes across multiple Node.js processes targeting the same file path without external file locking may cause race conditions or lost updates.

## Scripts

- `npm run build` compiles the library
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` runs TypeScript in no-emit mode
- `npm run test` runs Vitest with coverage
- `npm run verify` runs formatting, linting, typecheck, and tests

## Good First Contributions

The repo is designed so contributions add depth without collapsing extension points. Examples:

- Add a new memory backend that implements `MemoryStore`
- Introduce runtime policies around tool allowlists
- Add an event sink or tracing adapter
- Implement a model provider adapter with tests
- Expand task lifecycle states beyond the current happy path
- **Add a `wallet.sign` / `wallet.execute` tool path** that hands a prepared Stellar stub to the Lily backend for authorization and submission

## Suggested Next Issues

Maintainers can immediately create issues around:

- Provider adapters
- Runtime policies
- Persistent storage
- Wallet-aware execution boundaries
- Observability
- Documentation examples
- Test matrix expansion

The backlog section in the final delivery summary from this setup provides a ready-made issue starter list.
